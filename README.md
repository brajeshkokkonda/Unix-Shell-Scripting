# unix_shell_scripting
This repo holds examples of bash, ksh and csh. Helpful for beginners who are curious about popular and very important unix shell scripting. I used Ubuntu Linux 14.0 LTS for these examples.

This is my first github repo. Am learning by doing ;)
Basically shell scripting is similar to programming language. It also consists of variables, operators, expressions, conditional statements, loops, arrays, functions etc...
According to me this has to be learnt before any other programming language.
You can use any unix or linux os for working on shell scripting.
I have gone through the following books:
1. Unix shell scripting by yashwanth kanethkar (few printing errors in `expr $a + $b`)
2. Unix programming by forouzan
